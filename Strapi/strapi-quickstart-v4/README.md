## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

This Repo is slightly modified for deployment to a Azure Linux App Service as a Proof of Concep Project.
Below are some of the changes.

* Make sure deployment is using the app service build system (oryx) as with this framework you may face slow deployment times using any other method of deployment. You can make sure the oryx build is running by adding the following app settings: SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true
    - https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/main/doc/runtimes/nodejs.md
    - https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/main/doc/hosts/appservice.md


* Added .yarnrc file as deployment for some of the common packages may timeout.
  More information here: https://azureossd.github.io/2022/09/10/fix-yarn-ESOCKETTIMEDOUT-with-.yarnrc-configuration-file/index.html

* For the purpose of the project we have pointed to a database file stored under temporary storage /tmp/data.db. This is because SQLite 3 is not supported to be stored under the /home storage on app service due to locking issues. **You will lose your datafile file whenever the app service restarts for this project.**

* The Please configure your Strapi application to rely on a external database such as Azure MySQL or Azure PostGres when developing your application.
